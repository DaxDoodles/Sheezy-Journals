<p>
Yes, the dreaded paywall. In animation, it feels like they are EVERYWHERE and you aren't entirely wrong. <br> But that doesn't meen that animation as an artform is paywalled, or that the only way to get your hands on decent animation software is to "plunder and sail the seven seas" so; where are all the free options ? <br><br>
Well here is a comprehensive list of free animation programs with their pros and cons and some keywords that describe them.
<br><br> Now also keep in mind, I will not be including in this list drawing programs that have animation tools in built into them such as Krita, Procreate, or Clip Studio - Not only because some of these are payed but because you likely know that you can animate in them already - if you didn't, maybe double check if your drawing program have a set of animation tools built in.

<h2 id="aniterms"> -><- What do all these words mean ? -><- </h2>
<p>
If you are completely new to animation, I would imagine there is a lot of terminology that goes WAY over your head, things that more experienced animators take for granted and will spew at you any time you have ever asked about the craft. <br> <br>
So let me break down what all these words mean and detail how to use the tools and techniques they relate to. <br>
</p>

<h3 id="frames"> The name's Frames.. Key Frames.</h3>

<enf> Timeline ~ </enf> 
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">Within the timeline is where all of this information is Key (pun intended). <br>
Usually this element is what shows where all your layers and keys are relative to time, ordered in a neat line from frame 0 to whatever frame your animation ends on.
Depending on what program you are using you may also see a thumbnail image of what the frame looks like on screen.
<br><br> Knowing what franerate your timeline should be running on is quite simple - simply ask yourself "do you want your animation to be smooth like butter or can you sacrifice a couple of frames-per-second to ease your workload?" <br>
The industry standard framerate was 24fps or 25fps for hand drawn animation, but that number can be subjective depending on if you are animating on <u>Ones or Twos</u>, hold on -  But what does that mean?</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Animating on Ones: </u>This means that for every frame on the timeline, you are creating a new drawing or exposure, so quite a lot of work</li>
<li><u>Animating on Twos: </u>This means that for every 2 frames you are creating a new drawing, essentially cutting your work in half if you are a frame by frame animator.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> "Okay, but what is stopping me from creating a new drawing every 3, 4, 5 or however many frames I want?<br>
 Literally nothing. Just that the ones mentioned above are the most common practices, in fact mixing Ones and Twos is the most common way to animate in studios - and the end result will always look a bit different the more or less frames you use - The way you want it to look is the only factor to consider.</p>

<enf> Keyframes ~ </enf>  
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> The building blocks of all animation, though over time as technology has adapted, so too did the strict meaning of these words. <br>
In their most basic form "Keyframes" or often shortened to "Keys" refer to pivotal moments in an animation sequence - the start and end of any motion. <br>
<br> In some animation programs - especially ones that support tweening - a keyframe will usually be marked with a small <u>◆  symbol </u>  show that a key pose has been marked in your timeline. Though not all frames you will end up marking in these programs will be"keys" - that will depend entirely on how you are animating <br> <br> But for the sake of understanding know: these programs will still call them "keyframes" regardless of where you place them.
</p>

<enf> Breakdowns ~ </enf>  
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> Breakdowns aren't just the things that will happen when your animation isn't going right or you are missing a crucial deadline but an actual term that is important for the sake of the animation. <br><br>
They refer to the moment in-between the keys that changes the flow of the motion you are animating. It's a hard term to explain as for a lot of animation these terms can blur and mix, but hopefully this will help <u>break it down</u>  ;) </p>

<div style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <img src="https://file.garden/ZnGZOv7aF21WeO00/Journal%20stuff/Animation%20for%20Beginners/Breakdown.gif"  width="400px"  > </div>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> Though in this case the "breakdown" could also be considered a "key"... I did say the lines can blur! <small>which totally isn't confusing at all /s</small></p>

<p><enf>In-Betweens ~ </enf></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> In-Betweens is all the information you fill in from extreme to extreme or key to key to make the movement convincing - they are the fillings of the sandwich where the other 2 are the bread and spread of it - and although its the "filler" it will comprise 90% of your animation. <br><br>
The more In-Betweens a movement has the smoother it will be usually, though that also depends on your framerate, its a balance, as all good things should be. Get it wrong and you could end up having very smooth slowmo animation or very choppy and quick movements - But maybe that's what you are going for, I'm only here to explain the tools and how they work not dictate how you "should" do something</p>

<p><enf>Pose to Pose Animation ~  </enf></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> This is an animation technique that essentially means that you are planning out all your key poses before you get to filling out the rest of the information in-between. <br>
This is the most common way to animate, and seems like the most obvious, to know how your movement is going to stop and start but it is far from the only method. <br><br>
Animation is entirely contextual, if something you have animated using  "pose to pose"  is lacking a certain flow and feels almost robotic then you may need to consider the next technique. </p>

<p><enf>Straight Ahead Animation ~ </enf></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">Unline "Pose to Pose" the Straight Ahead animation technique is where you will animate in an almost chronological way, where you will draw frame 1 then 2 then 3, etc until the animation is finished. <br><br> You wont be marking the keys or breakdowns in this technique, simply seeing where the motion will go naturally, which is great for some effects animation, tho not so much for things like walkcycles or looping animations,</p>

<br><br> As this journal only really focuses on giving you a starting place more on the technical side of things rather than explaining how to make your motion fluid and natural. - Tho all the tools to do so are here in their most basic form. </p>
